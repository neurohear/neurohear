## About

NeuroHear is a deep learning toolkit for hearing aid algorithms, designed to fill the gap left by traditional DSP-based platforms like OpenMHA and Tympan.

### Key Features

- **Low-latency design**: Target latency <10ms for real-time hearing aid applications
- **Native PyTorch**: All algorithms implemented in PyTorch
- **ONNX export**: Cross-platform deployment support
- **Modular architecture**: Denoising, feedback suppression, and hearing compensation modules can be flexibly combined
